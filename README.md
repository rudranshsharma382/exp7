 Experiment 7 – Python While Loop Programs
*Aim*

To study and implement various programming problems using while loops in Python.

🎯 Objectives

To understand the working of while loop.

To implement number-based algorithms using iteration.

To use loop control statements like break and continue.

To perform operations like factorial, Fibonacci, palindrome check, digit count, and searching elements.

📚 Programs Included
1️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to 5
Algorithm

Initialize i = 1

While i < 6

Print i

Increment i by 1

Stop when condition becomes false

Functions / Concepts Used

while loop

Increment operator (+=)

2️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to N
Algorithm

Take input n

Initialize i = 1

While i <= n

Print i

Increment i

Functions Used

input()

int()

while

3️⃣ Factorial of a Number
Algorithm

Take input n

Initialize fact = 1

While n > 0

Multiply fact = fact * n

Decrement n

Print factorial

Functions Used

while

Arithmetic operators (*, -=)

4️⃣ Fibonacci Series (First N Terms)
Algorithm

Take input n

Initialize a = 0, b = 1

Repeat until n terms printed

Print a

Calculate next term c = a + b

Update values

Functions Used

while

Multiple assignment

end=" " in print

5️⃣ Fibonacci Series up to a Limit
Algorithm

Take input limit

Initialize a = 0, b = 1

While a <= limit

Print a

Update values

Functions Used

while

Tuple unpacking (a, b = b, a+b)

6️⃣ Reverse a Number
Algorithm

Take input num

Initialize rev = 0

While num > 0

Extract digit using modulus

Update reversed number

Remove last digit

Functions Used

% (modulus)

// (floor division)

while

7️⃣ Check Palindrome Number
Algorithm

Store original number

Reverse the number

Compare original and reversed

If equal → Palindrome

Functions Used

while

Conditional statement (if-else)

8️⃣ Check Palindrome String (Using Loop)
Algorithm

Take string

Initialize two pointers (i, j)

Compare characters from start and end

If mismatch → Not palindrome

Else → Palindrome

Functions Used

len()

while

String indexing

9️⃣ Check Palindrome String (Using Slicing)
Algorithm

Take string

Reverse string using slicing [::-1]

Compare both strings

Functions Used

String slicing

if-else

🔟 Count Number of Digits
Algorithm

Take input number

Initialize counter = 0

While number > 0

Divide number by 10

Increment counter

Functions Used

while

//

Counter variable

1️⃣1️⃣ Break Statement Example
Algorithm

Initialize i = 1

While i < 6

If i == 3, break loop

Otherwise print i

Functions Used

break

while

1️⃣2️⃣ Search Element in a List
Algorithm

Create list

Take input key

Traverse list using while loop

If found → Print index

Else → Print not found

Functions Used

len()

while

break

else with loop

1️⃣3️⃣ Continue Statement Example
Algorithm

Initialize i = 0

While i < 10

Increment i

If i is even → Continue

Print odd numbers

Functions Used

continue

Modulus operator %

🛠 Concepts Covered

while loop

Nested logic

Loop control statements (break, continue)

Conditional statements

Arithmetic operators

String slicing

List traversal

📊 Output

Each program produces correct output based on user input, demonstrating proper working of iteration and loop control structures.

✅ Result

The experiment was successfully executed.
All programs using the while loop were implemented and tested.
The concept of iteration, loop control statements, and number/string manipulation was clearly understood.
